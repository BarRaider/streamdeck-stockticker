## New in v1.4
**IMPORTANT:** The provider of the data we use (iexcloud.io) now requires a Free API token. I am working on finding a free solution that does not require an API token. In the mean time, see the ***Getting an API key*** section below for details on how to get a free one from iexcloud.io.

## Getting an API key
1. Register a free account at https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register  
2. Choose the "Start" free-tier option:

3. Verify the account by clicking on the email received  
4. Go to API Tokens (in the left menu of the website)  
5. Copy the "Publishable" token and paste it into the API key field in the Stream Deck settings
